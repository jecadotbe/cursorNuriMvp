Below is one straightforward way to move the colored dot outside the white “pill” while keeping the entire thing draggable. Essentially, you wrap both the dot and the white pill together in a single, horizontally‐aligned container—so they move as one unit when dragged.

1. Combine the Dot & Pill in One Flex Container
Instead of placing the dot inside the .bg-white.rounded-full pill, move it out so that it appears to the left (or right) of the pill. For instance:

tsx
Copy
<div
  className="absolute cursor-move member-pill group flex items-center"
  style={{ transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)" }}
>
  {/* Dot on the left */}
  <div
    className={`
      mr-2
      rounded-full
      bg-violet-600
      ${
        member.contactFrequency === 'S' ? 'w-2 h-2' :
        member.contactFrequency === 'M' ? 'w-2.5 h-2.5' :
        member.contactFrequency === 'L' ? 'w-3 h-3' :
        member.contactFrequency === 'XL' ? 'w-3.5 h-3.5' :
        'w-2 h-2'
      }
    `}
  />

  {/* The white pill */}
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 bg-white rounded-full px-3 py-1.5 shadow-sm border border-[#E5E7EB]">
    <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-800">{member.name}</span>
    <div className="hidden group-hover:flex items-center space-x-1">
      <button
        onClick={(e) => {
          e.stopPropagation();
          handleEdit(member);
        }}
        className="p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 rounded-full"
      >
        <Edit2 className="w-3 h-3 text-gray-500" />
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={(e) => {
          e.stopPropagation();
          setMemberToDelete(member);
        }}
        className="p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 rounded-full"
      >
        <Trash2 className="w-3 h-3 text-red-500" />
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
2. Ensure the Outer div Is the Draggable Element
By having the className="absolute cursor-move ... flex items-center" on the outer container, the dot and pill will drag together as a single unit.
If you’re using a library like React Draggable, wrap this entire container (dot + pill) in the <Draggable> component.
3. Adjust Spacing & Alignment
The mr-2 (or mr-1) on the dot adds a little horizontal gap.
The flex items-center ensures the dot is vertically centered with the pill.
Tweak the margin, spacing, or sizing to match your design exactly.
Result
By structuring it this way, you get:

The dot on the outside of the white pill.
One draggable container that includes both the dot and the pill text.
The same size logic for the dot (S, M, L, XL) you already had.
That’s it! Now you have the purple dot visually offset from the white pill—while still making the entire “dot + pill” entity draggable in one go.
