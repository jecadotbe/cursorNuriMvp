The Village members I add only seem to be stored in the session of the logged-in user in the specifc browser.When I open a new browser (incognito) and log-in the village memebers are gone. Can you explain what could be going on?EditLooking at the symptoms you're describing and the screenshots provided, this appears to be a client-state versus server-state persistence issue. Let me explain what's likely happening and how to fix it.
Currently, when you add Village members, they seem to only exist in the client-side state (browser memory) rather than being properly persisted to your database. Here's a detailed explanation of the probable causes:
The Application Flow

When you add a member through the UI, the data is being managed by React Query's client-side cache
This cache exists only in the current browser session
When you open an incognito window, you get a fresh session with no cached data
The fact that the data disappears in incognito suggests it's not being properly stored in your database

Potential Issues in the Implementation:

Database Storage
Your API endpoint might not be successfully writing to the database. The code might look something like this:

typescriptCopy// api/village/route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const data = await req.json()
    
    // This part might be missing or failing silently
    const newMember = await db.villageMembers.create({
      data: {
        ...data,
        userId: req.user.id  // Ensure user ID is included
      }
    })
    
    return Response.json(newMember)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create village member:', error)
    return Response.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 })
  }
}

Data Fetching
The initial data load might not be properly querying the database:

typescriptCopy// use-village.ts
export function useVillage() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['village-members'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/village')
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch village members')
      return response.json()
    }
  })
}
To fix this:

First, verify the database operations:

typescriptCopy// Add logging in your API route
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const data = await req.json()
    console.log('Attempting to create village member:', data)
    
    const newMember = await db.villageMembers.create({
      data: {
        ...data,
        userId: req.user.id
      }
    })
    console.log('Successfully created member:', newMember)
    
    return Response.json(newMember)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Database operation failed:', error)
    return Response.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 })
  }
}

Add error boundaries in your React components:

typescriptCopyif (error) {
  console.error('Village data error:', error)
  return <div>Error loading village data: {error.message}</div>
}

Verify the data flow:


Check your database logs to confirm write operations
Add console.logs in your API routes
Monitor the Network tab in Developer Tools to ensure requests are completing
Verify that successful responses include the correct data structure
