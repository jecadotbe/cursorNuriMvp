Here's a detailed summary of what we've accomplished and implemented:

Project Structure Overview:


Next.js application with TypeScript
Chat interface using Anthropic's Claude API
Navigation system between different views (Home, Chat, Village, Learn)


Core Components:


ChatView.tsx: Main chat interface with real-time messaging
HomeView.tsx: Landing page with gradient sections and navigation
VillageView.tsx: Work in progress with concentric circles visualization
Navigation.tsx: Bottom tab navigation system


API Integration Status:


Set up Anthropic API integration structure
Created environment variable configuration
Implemented backend service structure
Currently troubleshooting API connection issues


Key Features Implemented:


Message handling with typing indicators
User/Assistant avatar system
Timestamp formatting
Auto-scrolling messages
Navigation between views
Gradient backgrounds
Theme configuration


Current Issues Being Addressed:


Anthropic API integration not working despite correct setup
Environment variable configuration needs completion
Need to set up .env and .env.local files
Server-side API handling needs implementation


Environment Setup Required:


Need to create .env.local file
Configure next.config.js
Set up proper API key handling
Implement server-side routes


Visual Design Progress:


Implemented iOS-style chat interface
Added gradient backgrounds
Created village visualization (needs completion)
Implemented bottom navigation


Next Steps:


Complete API integration
Finish village visualization
Add proper error handling
Implement message persistence
Add loading states


Technical Implementation Details:


Using React hooks for state management
Implemented TypeScript interfaces
Set up proper routing system
Created reusable components


Navigation System:


Bottom tab navigation
Back button functionality
View switching mechanism
State management for current view
