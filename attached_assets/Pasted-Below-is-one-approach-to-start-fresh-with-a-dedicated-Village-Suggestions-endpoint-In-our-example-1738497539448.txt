Below is one approach to “start fresh” with a dedicated Village Suggestions endpoint. In our example, we’ll create a new set of API endpoints (one for fetching suggestions and one for marking a suggestion as used) along with the underlying generation logic. This way, you isolate village-specific logic from other suggestion endpoints, which makes it easier to test and maintain.

Below is an example implementation using Express and TypeScript. (You can adjust for your framework or ORM as needed.)

1. Define the API Routes
Create a new router (for example, in src/routes/villageSuggestions.ts) that exposes your dedicated endpoints:

typescript
Copy
// src/routes/villageSuggestions.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { getVillageSuggestions, markVillageSuggestionAsUsed } from '../controllers/villageSuggestionsController';

const router = Router();

// GET /api/village-suggestions
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Assume that authentication middleware attaches `user` to the request
    const userId = req.user.id;
    const suggestions = await getVillageSuggestions(userId);
    res.json({ suggestions });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching village suggestions:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
});

// POST /api/village-suggestions/:suggestionId/use
router.post('/:suggestionId/use', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.id;
    const suggestionId = parseInt(req.params.suggestionId, 10);
    await markVillageSuggestionAsUsed(userId, suggestionId);
    res.json({ message: 'Suggestion marked as used.' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error marking suggestion as used:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
});

export default router;
2. Implement the Controller Logic
Create a controller (for example, in src/controllers/villageSuggestionsController.ts) that contains the logic for fetching and updating suggestions. This controller will:

Check if active suggestions already exist.
If not, generate new suggestions using village data, recent chats, and (if applicable) relevant memories.
Insert any new suggestions into the database and return them.
typescript
Copy
// src/controllers/villageSuggestionsController.ts
import { query } from '../db'; // Your database query helper
import { analyzeVillageGaps, getRelevantMemories } from '../services/suggestionService';
import { getUserVillageMembers, getRecentChats } from '../services/villageService';

export async function getVillageSuggestions(userId: number) {
  // 1. Check for active (not yet used and not expired) suggestions.
  let suggestions = await query(
    `
    SELECT * FROM prompt_suggestions 
    WHERE user_id = $1 
      AND used_at IS NULL 
      AND expires_at > NOW()
    `,
    [userId]
  );

  if (suggestions.length > 0) {
    return suggestions;
  }

  // 2. Fetch village members and perform gap analysis.
  const members = await getUserVillageMembers(userId);
  const gaps = analyzeVillageGaps(members);

  // 3. Process recent chat context.
  const recentChats = await getRecentChats(userId);
  const recentMessages = recentChats
    .slice(0, 2)
    .flatMap((chat: any) => chat.messages) // assuming messages is an array
    .slice(-5);

  // 4. Optionally retrieve relevant memories.
  const memories = await getRelevantMemories(userId, recentMessages);

  // 5. Generate new suggestions based on gaps (and optionally memories/chat context).
  const newSuggestions: any[] = [];
  const now = new Date();
  // For example, set expiration to 24 hours from now:
  const expiresAt = new Date(now.getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

  if (gaps.innerCircleMissing) {
    newSuggestions.push({
      user_id: userId,
      text: 'You might consider reconnecting with someone from your inner circle.',
      type: 'village',
      context: 'inner_circle_gap',
      relevance: 10,
      used_at: null,
      expires_at: expiresAt,
      created_at: now,
    });
  }

  if (gaps.outerCircleLackDiversity) {
    newSuggestions.push({
      user_id: userId,
      text: 'Expanding your outer network could lead to fresh perspectives!',
      type: 'village',
      context: 'outer_network_diversity',
      relevance: 8,
      used_at: null,
      expires_at: expiresAt,
      created_at: now,
    });
  }

  // 6. Insert new suggestions into the database.
  const insertedSuggestions = [];
  for (const suggestion of newSuggestions) {
    const result = await query(
      `
      INSERT INTO prompt_suggestions 
        (user_id, text, type, context, relevance, used_at, expires_at, created_at)
      VALUES 
        ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8)
      RETURNING *
      `,
      [
        suggestion.user_id,
        suggestion.text,
        suggestion.type,
        suggestion.context,
        suggestion.relevance,
        suggestion.used_at,
        suggestion.expires_at,
        suggestion.created_at,
      ]
    );
    insertedSuggestions.push(result[0]);
  }

  return insertedSuggestions;
}

export async function markVillageSuggestionAsUsed(userId: number, suggestionId: number) {
  // Update the suggestion to mark it as used (only if it belongs to the current user).
  await query(
    `
    UPDATE prompt_suggestions
    SET used_at = NOW()
    WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2
    `,
    [suggestionId, userId]
  );
}
3. Implement Supporting Service Functions
To keep our code modular, we create services for:

Analyzing the village gaps.
Fetching village members and recent chats.
(Optionally) retrieving relevant memories.
Service: Village Gap Analysis & Memory Retrieval

typescript
Copy
// src/services/suggestionService.ts
export function analyzeVillageGaps(members: any[]) {
  // Example logic:
  const innerCircle = members.filter(member => member.circle === 1);
  const outerCircle = members.filter(member => member.circle === 4);

  return {
    innerCircleMissing: innerCircle.length < 2, // adjust threshold as needed
    outerCircleLackDiversity: outerCircle.length < 4, // adjust threshold as needed
  };
}

export async function getRelevantMemories(userId: number, chatContext: any[]) {
  // Implement the logic to retrieve relevant memories.
  // For now, return an empty array or dummy data.
  return [];
}
Service: Fetching Village Data

typescript
Copy
// src/services/villageService.ts
import { query } from '../db';

export async function getUserVillageMembers(userId: number) {
  const members = await query(
    `
    SELECT * FROM village_members
    WHERE user_id = $1
    `,
    [userId]
  );
  return members;
}

export async function getRecentChats(userId: number) {
  const chats = await query(
    `
    SELECT * FROM chats
    WHERE user_id = $1
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT 2
    `,
    [userId]
  );
  return chats;
}
Database Helper (if not already defined):

typescript
Copy
// src/db/index.ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  // additional configuration if needed
});

export async function query(text: string, params?: any[]) {
  const res = await pool.query(text, params);
  return res.rows;
}
4. Integrate in Your Application
Finally, ensure you register the new router in your main Express app (for example, in src/app.ts or src/index.ts):

typescript
Copy
import express from 'express';
import villageSuggestionsRouter from './routes/villageSuggestions';

const app = express();

// (Other middleware, e.g., JSON parsing, authentication, etc.)

app.use('/api/village-suggestions', villageSuggestionsRouter);

// Error handling middleware, etc.

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running...');
});
Summary & Recommendations
Isolate the Logic:
By creating a dedicated endpoint (/api/village-suggestions), you separate village-specific suggestion logic from other suggestion mechanisms. This isolation makes debugging and future modifications easier.

Modular Structure:
Splitting the code into routes, controllers, and services (along with a dedicated database helper) improves readability and maintainability.

Incremental Approach:
Start by returning basic suggestions (based on gap analysis). Later, integrate more complex logic (e.g., incorporating recent chats and memories) as needed.

Testing:
Be sure to add tests (unit and integration) for each module. For example, verify that the gap analysis returns the correct flags given certain village member data, and that the endpoints respond with the expected suggestions.

This approach should give you a clean, maintainable starting point for your village suggestions feature. Feel free to expand or adjust the code based on your project’s specific needs.
